# CHIP-8 Emulator

## Summary
Chip-8 implementation in C++ programming language while
I was learning the language.


    Add Super CHIP-8 Opcodes
    Use function pointers instead of a giant switch statement
    Improve graphics by adding filters (Hqx)
    Port it to other platforms (Mobile?) or languages
    Move on to a more complex project for example emulating a Gameboy (Z80 processor)
